This file describes my process of moving from the hieratic of the Kairo JE 9585 image of Spells 23-26 Book of the Dead into Jsesh.gly format. This file serves as reminder to me so I don't have to relearn the steps each time I work on a new line.


For Hieratic texts that typically read right to left.

In Jsesh
File > Format > Right to Left Text

Using a mix of MdC and Gardiner Code create the line of glyphs.
-separate glyphs.
: allows glyphs to be stacked.

Use the Aaou dictionary which also includes the Gardiner codes.

Looks something like: sw-w-P6-D36:D54-nTrw-G7-Z3A-r-s
